Create a new branch
```shell
git switch main # make sure you are on the main branch
git pull # keep the main branch up to date
git switch -c branchname # create and switch to a new branch
git push -u origin branchname # publish the new branch to remote
```
After making changes on the new branch
```shell
git add . # stage all the changed files
git commit -m "message" # commit changes
git push # publish the changes to remote
```
Open an pull request on Github

If you want to pull another remote branch that was not created by you
```shell
git fetch origin remotebranchname # get remote branch to local
git switch remotebranchname 
```
